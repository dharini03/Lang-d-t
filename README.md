# Language Detection and Translation Web Application

## Overview

This project is a web application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect the language of input text and translate it into a target language. Built using Python and the Gradio framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Features

- **Language Detection**: Automatically identifies the language of the input text using a trained machine learning model.
- **Real-time Translation**: Translates detected text into a user-selected target language using the Google Translate API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive experience for users.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Supports a wide range of languages for both detection and translation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **Gradio**: Framework for building the web application interface.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning, used for training the language detection model.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **googletrans**: Library for accessing the Google Translate API for translation services.
- **pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
